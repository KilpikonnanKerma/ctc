# Cursed to Consume

## What is it?
A school project I started in september/october 2024. Cursed to Consume is a horror platformer/almost metroidvania-like(?) game made with Godot 4.3 and GDScript.

## Is it still developed?
No. Atleast not actively. I may continue this project sometime. I've made the project open source so anyone can look at the code; maybe learn from it and also play the game.

## How can I play it?
1. Install Godot (preferably version 4.3 - You can find it on Steam, where you can install it easily)
2. Download the source code for this repo from the releases page.
3. Open the project in Godot
4. Press play or build the project to play it.

## Can I modify the project?
I've licensed this project under MIT License. Refer to the license file for more information about modification.
